# Obstacle-avoiding-Car

Our project is based on an obstacle avoiding car that can automatically sense the obstacle 
in its way and avoid it by changing the direction. 
This design allows the robot to navigate in an unknown environment by avoiding collisions which is the primary requirement for autonomous mobile vehicles. 
It's designed as a four-wheeled car having a board at its top and an ultrasonic sensor at the front to avoid obstacles.

CONCLUSION
----------

The hardware project performed as per our expectations and worked autonomously, that is, after feeding the code
it required no human interaction and could work on its own, even in unknown and dynamic environments.
